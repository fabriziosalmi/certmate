## Key Findings Summary

### Strengths
- Modular, pluggable storage backend system
- Multi-account support infrastructure
- Flexible JSON metadata structure
- RESTful API design (Flask-RESTX)
- Extensible CA provider system
- Backward-compatible architecture

### Weaknesses for Client Certificates
- Certbot doesn't support client certificates
- Domain-centric storage model (client certs don't have domains)
- No key usage/extended key usage configuration
- Renewal logic assumes domain-based expiry
- Web UI optimized for server certificates only

### Recommended Changes for Client Certificate Support

**Phase 1: Infrastructure** (No breaking changes)
- Add `certificate_type` field to metadata
- Create `client_certificates/` storage path
- Extend StorageManager for type-aware operations
- Add certificate type to API models

**Phase 2: Client Cert Management**
- Create ClientCertificateManager class
- Implement CSR creation and submission
- Add certificate signing workflows
- Support manual cert upload

**Phase 3: Web UI Updates**
- Add certificate type toggle
- Create client cert management tab
- Add CSR generation interface
- Add revocation management

**Phase 4: Advanced Features**
- Certificate chain building
- Batch client cert issuance
- ACME support (if applicable)
- Audit logging for client certs

## Key Technology Stack

**Backend**
- Python 3.9+
- Flask + Flask-RESTX
- Certbot (ACME client)
- APScheduler (scheduled tasks)
- Cloud SDKs (Azure, AWS, HashiCorp, Infisical)

**Frontend**
- HTML5 + Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Font Awesome icons

**Storage**
- Local Filesystem (default)
- Azure Key Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Infisical

**Deployment**
- Docker/Docker Compose
- Kubernetes compatible

## Important Limitations

1. **Certbot Limitation**: Certbot designed for server-side TLS, doesn't support client certificates or custom key usage
2. **Domain-Centric**: Directory structure assumes one certificate per domain
3. **No Database**: Uses JSON file (settings.json) - simpler but less flexible
4. **DNS-01 Only**: ACME challenges via DNS ownership only
5. **Server-Certificate Focused**: All metadata and UI optimized for server certificates
